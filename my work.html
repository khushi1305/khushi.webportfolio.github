									<b>1.	Lyrics Grabber</b> <br><br>
									
									<p> As a part of my diploma course, I'd done this project based on music, which is done using Html, Css, Bootstrap as front-end and
									Php and MySql as back-end.</p>
									
									<p> This project consists of the development of a contributory website to display lyrics of the bollywood songs. 
									The goal of this website is to allow users to sing along with the lyrics. There are many such applications available in the market, 
									but it needs to be downloaded and requires storage space. Here, user can find all kinds of music genres and play music according to the mood. 
									LYRICS GRABBER incorporates premium user facility, which provides a high quality audio with downloading facility. This website allows 
									user to search for their favorite songs according to song name, artist, album and also create a playlist.  </p>
									
									<p> It is a completely dynamic website in which all the songs, albums, artists, playlist and everything comes from the database linked with it.
									Some pictures of the front page are displayed below...</p>

									<b>2.	Bookish</b> <br><br>
									<p> This is a project I'm making for learning purpose. I've not yet finished this project completely, but I can describe what it is about. </p>
									
									<p> Bookish is a website in php, which contains a huge collection of bestseller books. User can purchase books from this website at a very
									cheaper cost. This is an e-commerce website merely for books, so that users can be comfortable while searching for the books and can get every 
									book they need. It is a dynamic website in which the book's cover page and details will be directly fetched from the database. User can add the
									books to wishlist and a cart facility will be provided along with payment methods. The work is still going on, but still I have some 
									pictures of it's front page displayed below...</p>
